# Our approach: what we need to research & model
 - How a lack of cholinergic neurotransmission (muscarinic receptors? - M5 receptors in the blood vessels) results in a lack of blood flow to the brain 
 - How that lack of blood flow impairs visual processing (in the V5/MT area? - this area sends signals to the association areas, first area to appear abnormal in lewy body patients)
 - How using ChEIs can be used to increase acetylcholine transfer to fix these problems
